# Static Resume Builder

Comment on Your Interactive Resume:
Your interactive resume is well-structured, providing a clear and organized presentation of your skills, experience, and education. You’ve utilized HTML effectively to create a visually appealing and functional layout. Below are some comments and suggestions to further enhance your project:

Positives:
Clear Structure:
The code is neatly structured, making it easy to read and understand. Each section (Objective, Skills, Experience, etc.) is well-defined and logically placed.

Responsive Design:
You've included the meta viewport tag, which ensures your resume is mobile-friendly and responsive.

Use of Tables:
Displaying skills, experience, and education in tables makes the information easy to scan and understand.

Navigation Bar:
The navigation bar provides smooth scrolling to different sections, enhancing the user experience.

Toggle Feature:
The toggle button for the Skills section is a nice interactive touch, making the resume dynamic.

Footer with External Link:
Including a link to your favorite YouTuber’s channel (AkazBaba) is a creative way to add a personal touch to your resume.

Suggestions for Improvement:
Avoid Using <marquee> (Deprecated):
The <marquee> tag is outdated and not supported by modern browsers. Consider using CSS animations or a JavaScript solution for scrolling text.
Example:

css
Copy code
.marquee {
  overflow: hidden;
  white-space: nowrap;
  animation: scroll 10s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes scroll {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(100%);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateX(-100%);
  }
}
Improve Accessibility:
Add alt text descriptions for images that provide more meaningful context. For example:

html
Copy code
<img src="photo.jpeg" class="profile-picture" alt="Photo of Syed Abbas Ali Zaidi" />
Consistent Naming Conventions:
The id="Experiance_Title" has a spelling error. It should be Experience_Title.

Add More Semantic Elements:
Using semantic HTML elements like <section>, <article>, and <footer> improves the structure and accessibility of your page.

CSS for Styling:
Enhance the visual appearance by adding more CSS for layout, colors, and fonts. For instance, you can:

Use flexbox or grid for a more modern layout.
Add hover effects to the navigation links for a better user experience.
Use External Links in New Tabs:
For the external link to AkazBaba's YouTube channel, consider opening it in a new tab:

html
Copy code
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@akazbaba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Enhance Interactivity with JavaScript:
You could add JavaScript to enhance user experience, such as a "Back to Top" button that smoothly scrolls to the top or a theme toggle button for light/dark mode.

Example Enhancements:
Smooth Scroll for Navigation Links:
Add this CSS for smooth scrolling:

css
Copy code
html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
Animated Button for "Go to Top":
Add a hover effect to your "Top" button:

css
Copy code
#topbutton:hover {
  background-color: #555;
  color: white;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: 0.3s;
}
